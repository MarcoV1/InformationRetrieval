Looks good, functions meh	2 issues  -  Once I turned on the circle apps and installed this case,  my battery drained twice as fast as usual.  I ended up turning off the circle apps, which kind of makes the case just a case...  with a hole in it.  Second,  the wireless charging doesn't work.  I have a Motorola 360 watch and a Qi charging pad. The watch charges fine but this case doesn't. But hey, it looks nice.
